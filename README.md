# Neuromodulation-induced Normalization of Cortical Metastable Dynamics in Parkinson’s Disease


**Code Availability Notice**  
*Last updated: April 21, 2025*  

This repository contains analysis and visualization code for the manuscript:  
**"Neuromodulation-induced Normalization of Cortical Metastable Dynamics in Parkinson’s Disease"**  

### Current Status  
⚠️ **Code under active organization**  
The codebase is currently being refactored for reproducibility and documentation. Key components include:  
- Preprocessing pipelines for neural dynamics data  
- Weighted Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (WEiDA) on resting-state fMRI data
- Metastability metric calculations for deep brain stimulation (DBS) and temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) 
- Visualization for cortical state transitions  

### Expected Release  
⌛ **Full code release: May 2025**  
We aim to publish:  
1. Version-controlled scripts with dependency management  
2. Jupyter Notebook/Python demo workflows  
3. Sample datasets for validation  
4. Detailed documentation including parameter tuning guides
